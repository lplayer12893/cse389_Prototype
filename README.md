# on the TCC linux, use $ git clone [git address, see Code section]
# it will put it in Documents/Github/cse389_Prototype, or something like that
# when you have made changes on your computer, run $ git commit -m "[your message saying what you're committing]"
# next run $ git pull to get the most up to date code and possibly merge your changes with someone elses
# next run $ git push

# rules:
#   always pull before you start working
#   always commit before you pull if you've made changes. In the case of a merge conflict, edit the files you have changed.
#     the errors will be denoted by weird characters separating a section of code deemed erroneous
# order of operations: commit, pull, push
